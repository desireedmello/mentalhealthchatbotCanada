Mental health issues are often not discussed due to the stigma behind it and this results in people hesitating to seek help for their mental illnesses. Although the Canadian Government has funded a plethora of mental health resources for the general public, not many people opt for these support platforms. The main reason for this is the lack of awarness regarding mental health concerns and the genuine resources available in Canada. This Chatbot has been developed to enable users to learn more about their mental health concerns and provides reliable support information taken from the official [Government of Canada](https://www.canada.ca/en/public-health/topics/mental-health-wellness.html) website.
